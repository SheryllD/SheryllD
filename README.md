I am a strategic and data-driven marketing professional with over 15 years experience in marketing, data analytics, and project management. My expertise lies in optimising digital strategies, leveraging data insights, improving processes and driving business growth.

With a growing expertise in data analytics, data science, AI and software engineering, I am continuously expanding my skills in R, Python, MERN Stack, SQL, BigQuery, Tableau, Machine Learning and Looker Studio to extract meaningful insights, automate processes, and improving decision-making. Beyond marketing, I have hands-on experience in full-stack web development, working with the MERN stack to create digital solutions, shipping products fast that integrate business with user experience. My ability to bridge the gap between marketing, technology, and operations allows me to build efficient, high-performing teams and deliver sustainable growth.
