# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sheryll, 

I am a strategic and data-driven marketing leader with over 15 years of experience in performance marketing, marketing analytics, and project management. My expertise lies in optimising digital strategies, leveraging data insights, improving processes and driving business growth.

With a growing expertise in data analytics, data science, AI and software engineering, I am continuously expanding my skills in R, Python, MERN Stack, SQL, BigQuery, Tableau, Machine Learning and Looker Studio to extract meaningful insights, automate processes, and improving decision-making. I have successfully led multi-million euro marketing campaigns and projects, implemented scalable strategies in SEM, SEO, Affiliate Marketing, Social Media, and developed data-driven frameworks for improving customer acquisition and retention.

Beyond marketing, I have hands-on experience in full-stack web development, working with the MERN stack to create digital solutions, shipping products fast that integrate business with user experience. My ability to bridge the gap between marketing, technology, and operations allows me to build efficient, high-performing teams and deliver sustainable growth.

I thrive in dynamic environments where innovation, analytical thinking, and strategic execution come together. Whether leading teams, optimising workflows, or refining digital strategies, my focus is on delivering results, improving efficiency, and driving long-term business success.

I am enthusiastic about connecting with like-minded professionals and am always open to collaborations and new opportunities!

Let's connect! :)
